### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Thiago Colebrusco. I have been working with software engineering for the past 15 years and I've worn many hats in my career: developer, tech lead, manager, company owner and teacher. Now I am currently working remotely for an US company for the past 3,5 years - started as developer and then became tech lead.

Currently I am working as a Full Stack, but I am mostly inclined to backend stuff. It really excites me when I have to work on fixing performance issues, manipulating big chunks of data or integrating with other services. But I also like building up some good UI that users will enjoy working on.

Throughout my career, I have developed and maintained applications used by hundreds of users, including an application used to manage the operation of a franchise with 150+ stores.
